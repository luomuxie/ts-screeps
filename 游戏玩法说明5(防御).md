# 游戏玩法说明5——防御
The world of Screeps is not the safest place. Other players may have claims on your territory. Besides, your room may be raided by neutral NPC creeps occasionally. So you ought to think about your colony defense in order to develop it successfully.

1、激活安全模式

The surest way to fend off an attack is using the room Safe Mode. In safe mode, no other creep will be able to use any harmful methods in the room (but you’ll still be able to defend against strangers).
The safe mode is activated via the room controller which should have activations available to use. Let’s spend one activation to turn it on in our room.
```js
Game.spawns['Spawn1'].room.controller.activateSafeMode();
```
2、防御塔

Towers are the easiest way to actively defend a room. They use energy and can be targeted at any creep in a room to attack or heal it. The effect depends on the distance between the tower and the target.

To start with, let’s lay a foundation for our new tower. You can set any place you wish inside the walls and place the construction site there with the help of the button “Construct” on the upper panel.
```js
Game.spawns['Spawn1'].room.createConstructionSite( 23, 22, STRUCTURE_TOWER );
```
A tower uses energy, so let’s set the harvester role to bring energy to the tower along with other structures. To do this, you need to add the constant STRUCTURE_TOWER to the filter of structures your harvester is aimed at.

Add STRUCTURE_TOWER to the module role.harvester and wait for the energy to appear in the tower.
```js
var roleHarvester = {

    /** @param {Creep} creep **/
    run: function(creep) {
	    if(creep.store.getFreeCapacity() > 0) {
            var sources = creep.room.find(FIND_SOURCES);
            if(creep.harvest(sources[0]) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
                creep.moveTo(sources[0], {visualizePathStyle: {stroke: '#ffaa00'}});
            }
        }
        else {
            var targets = creep.room.find(FIND_STRUCTURES, {
                    filter: (structure) => {
                        return (structure.structureType == STRUCTURE_EXTENSION ||
                                structure.structureType == STRUCTURE_SPAWN ||
                                structure.structureType == STRUCTURE_TOWER) && 
                                structure.store.getFreeCapacity(RESOURCE_ENERGY) > 0;
                    }
            });
            if(targets.length > 0) {
                if(creep.transfer(targets[0], RESOURCE_ENERGY) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
                    creep.moveTo(targets[0], {visualizePathStyle: {stroke: '#ffffff'}});
                }
            }
        }
	}
};

module.exports = roleHarvester;
```

3、控制防御塔，开始攻击
Excellent, your tower is ready to use!
Like a creep, a tower has several similar methods: attack, heal, and repair. Each action spends 10 energy units. We need to use attack on the closest enemy creep upon its discovery. Remember that distance is vital: the effect can be several times stronger with the same energy cost!

To get the tower object directly you can use its ID from the right panel and the method Game.getObjectById.
```js
    var tower = Game.getObjectById('98ee658e29a09ec7f2b9b458');
    if(tower) {
        var closestHostile = tower.pos.findClosestByRange(FIND_HOSTILE_CREEPS);
        if(closestHostile) {
            tower.attack(closestHostile);
        }
    }
```

现在的main.js结构为
```js
var roleHarvester = require('role.harvester');
var roleUpgrader = require('role.upgrader');
var roleBuilder = require('role.builder');

module.exports.loop = function () {

    var tower = Game.getObjectById('98ee658e29a09ec7f2b9b458');
    if(tower) {
        var closestHostile = tower.pos.findClosestByRange(FIND_HOSTILE_CREEPS);
        if(closestHostile) {
            tower.attack(closestHostile);
        }
    }

    for(var name in Game.creeps) {
        var creep = Game.creeps[name];
        if(creep.memory.role == 'harvester') {
            roleHarvester.run(creep);
        }
        if(creep.memory.role == 'upgrader') {
            roleUpgrader.run(creep);
        }
        if(creep.memory.role == 'builder') {
            roleBuilder.run(creep);
        }
    }
}
```
4、使用防御塔修理防御墙

The enemy creep is eliminated and our colony can breathe easy. However, the invader has damaged some walls during the brief attack. You’d better set up auto-repair.

Damaged structures can be repaired by both creeps and towers. Let’s try to use a tower for that. We’ll need the method repair. You will also need the method 
```js
Room.find
filter
```
to locate the damaged walls.

Note that since walls don’t belong to any player, finding them requires the constant FIND_STRUCTURES rather than FIND_MY_STRUCTURES.
```js
var roleHarvester = require('role.harvester');
var roleUpgrader = require('role.upgrader');
var roleBuilder = require('role.builder');

module.exports.loop = function () {

    var tower = Game.getObjectById('98ee658e29a09ec7f2b9b458');
    if(tower) {
        var closestDamagedStructure = tower.pos.findClosestByRange(FIND_STRUCTURES, {
            filter: (structure) => structure.hits < structure.hitsMax
        });
        if(closestDamagedStructure) {
            tower.repair(closestDamagedStructure);
        }

        var closestHostile = tower.pos.findClosestByRange(FIND_HOSTILE_CREEPS);
        if(closestHostile) {
            tower.attack(closestHostile);
        }
    }

    for(var name in Game.creeps) {
        var creep = Game.creeps[name];
        if(creep.memory.role == 'harvester') {
            roleHarvester.run(creep);
        }
        if(creep.memory.role == 'upgrader') {
            roleUpgrader.run(creep);
        }
        if(creep.memory.role == 'builder') {
            roleBuilder.run(creep);
        }
    }
}
```
