The Controller upgrade gives access to some new structures: walls, ramparts, and extensions. We’ll discuss walls and ramparts in the next Tutorial section, for now let’s talk about extensions.

Extensions are required to build larger creeps. A creep with only one body part of one type works poorly. Giving it several WORKs will make him work proportionally faster.

However, such a creep will be costly and a lone spawn can only contain 300 energy units. To build creeps costing over 300 energy units you need spawn extensions.

The second Controller level has 5 extensions available for you to build. This number increases with each new level.
You can place extensions at any spot in your room, and a spawn can use them regardless of the distance. In this Tutorial we have already placed corresponding construction sites for your convenience.
