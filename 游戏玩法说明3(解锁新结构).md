# 升级小兵
The Controller upgrade gives access to some new structures: walls, ramparts, and extensions. We’ll discuss walls and ramparts in the next Tutorial section, for now let’s talk about extensions.

Extensions are required to build larger creeps. A creep with only one body part of one type works poorly. Giving it several WORKs will make him work proportionally faster.

However, such a creep will be costly and a lone spawn can only contain 300 energy units. To build creeps costing over 300 energy units you need spawn extensions.

由于前面升级了控制器到2级,所以多了5个能量存储包（暂时这样叫）

The second Controller level has 5 extensions available for you to build. This number increases with each new level.
You can place extensions at any spot in your room, and a spawn can use them regardless of the distance. In this Tutorial we have already placed corresponding construction sites for your convenience。

1、创建一个新的creep来建造存满这5个能量包,方式和前面一样
Let’s create a new creep whose purpose is to build structures. This process will be similar to the previous Tutorial sections. But this time let’s set memory for the new creep right in the method Spawn.spawnCreep by passing it in the third argument.

Spawn a creep with the body [WORK,CARRY,MOVE], the name Builder1, and {role:'builder'} as its memory.
```js
Game.spawns['Spawn1'].spawnCreep( [WORK, CARRY, MOVE], 'Builder1',
    { memory: { role: 'builder' } } );

```
2、创建一个建造者模块

As before, let’s move this role into a separate module role.builder. The building is carried out by applying the method Creep.build to the construction sites searchable by Room.find(FIND_CONSTRUCTION_SITES). The structure requires energy which your creep can harvest on its own.

To avoid having the creep run back and forth too often but make it deplete the cargo, let’s complicate our logic by creating a new Boolean variable creep.memory.building which will tell the creep when to switch tasks. We'll also add new creep.say call and visualizePathStyle option to the moveTo method to visualize the creep's intentions.
```js
var roleBuilder = {

    /** @param {Creep} creep **/
    run: function(creep) {

	    if(creep.memory.building && creep.store[RESOURCE_ENERGY] == 0) {
            creep.memory.building = false;
            creep.say('🔄 harvest');
	    }
	    if(!creep.memory.building && creep.store.getFreeCapacity() == 0) {
	        creep.memory.building = true;
	        creep.say('🚧 build');
	    }

	    if(creep.memory.building) {
	        var targets = creep.room.find(FIND_CONSTRUCTION_SITES);
            if(targets.length) {
                if(creep.build(targets[0]) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
                    creep.moveTo(targets[0], {visualizePathStyle: {stroke: '#ffffff'}});
                }
            }
	    }
	    else {
	        var sources = creep.room.find(FIND_SOURCES);
            if(creep.harvest(sources[0]) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
                creep.moveTo(sources[0], {visualizePathStyle: {stroke: '#ffaa00'}});
            }
	    }
	}
};

module.exports = roleBuilder;
```
此时main的结构为
```js
var roleHarvester = require('role.harvester');
var roleBuilder = require('role.builder');

module.exports.loop = function () {

    for(var name in Game.creeps) {
        var creep = Game.creeps[name];
        if(creep.memory.role == 'harvester') {
            roleHarvester.run(creep);
        }
        if(creep.memory.role == 'builder') {
            roleBuilder.run(creep);
        }
    }
}
```
3、重写收割者模块
Maintaining extensions requires you to teach your harvesters to carry energy not just to a spawn but also to extensions. To do this, you can either use the Game.structures object or search within the room with the help of Room.find(FIND_STRUCTURES). In both cases, you will need to filter the list of items on the condition structure.structureType == STRUCTURE_EXTENSION (or, alternatively, structure instanceof StructureExtension) and also check them for energy load, as before.
```js
var roleHarvester = {

    /** @param {Creep} creep **/
    run: function(creep) {
	    if(creep.store.getFreeCapacity() > 0) {
            var sources = creep.room.find(FIND_SOURCES);
            if(creep.harvest(sources[0]) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
                creep.moveTo(sources[0], {visualizePathStyle: {stroke: '#ffaa00'}});
            }
        }
        else {
            var targets = creep.room.find(FIND_STRUCTURES, {
                    filter: (structure) => {
                        return (structure.structureType == STRUCTURE_EXTENSION || structure.structureType == STRUCTURE_SPAWN) &&
                            structure.store.getFreeCapacity(RESOURCE_ENERGY) > 0;
                    }
            });
            if(targets.length > 0) {
                if(creep.transfer(targets[0], RESOURCE_ENERGY) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
                    creep.moveTo(targets[0], {visualizePathStyle: {stroke: '#ffffff'}});
                }
            }
        }
	}
};

module.exports = roleHarvester;
```
4、计算所有能量值main.js
```js
var roleHarvester = require('role.harvester');
var roleBuilder = require('role.builder');

module.exports.loop = function () {

    for(var name in Game.rooms) {
        console.log('Room "'+name+'" has '+Game.rooms[name].energyAvailable+' energy');
    }

    for(var name in Game.creeps) {
        var creep = Game.creeps[name];
        if(creep.memory.role == 'harvester') {
            roleHarvester.run(creep);
        }
        if(creep.memory.role == 'builder') {
            roleBuilder.run(creep);
        }
    }
}
```
5、当能量达到550，可创建中级小兵

In total, we have 550 energy units in our spawn and extensions. It is enough to build a creep with the body [WORK,WORK,WORK,WORK,CARRY,MOVE,MOVE]. This creep will work 4 times faster than a regular worker creep. Its body is heavier, so we’ll add another MOVE to it. However, two parts are still not enough to move it at the speed of a small fast creep which would require 4xMOVEs or building a road.
```js
Game.spawns['Spawn1'].spawnCreep( [WORK,WORK,WORK,WORK,CARRY,MOVE,MOVE],
    'HarvesterBig',
    { memory: { role: 'harvester' } } );
```
